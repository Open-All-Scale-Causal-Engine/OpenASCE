# Causal Inference using Causal Graph

## Causal Graph

The causal graph can be the probabilistic graphical model used to encode assumptions about the data-generating process, and graphical models are the language of causality. So we can use the graphical causal model for inference.

## Inference through Causal Graph

We implemented a backdoor adjustment method to correct the spurious correlation in the observational data, which can remove the confounding bias in the observational data and accurately estimate the marginal distribution after an intervention.
