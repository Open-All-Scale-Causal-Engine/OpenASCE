# Causal Inferenece using T-Model

T-Model, also called two model, which models the control and treatment groups respectively.
When the sample data of the test group and the control group are unbalanced or the data distribution difference is too large, cumulative errors are likely to occur.
Refer to the paper [link](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/gutierrez17a/gutierrez17a.pdf) and the example `examples/openasce/inference/t_model/t_model_regression_test.py`.
